A Little History
It all started with two artists, a shared dream, and a leap of faith.
Back in college, Andy and Cynthia Lenz met through their love of art, fell in love with each other, and eventually got married. With art degrees in hand, they moved to the coastal town of Santa Cruz—a place close to Cynthia’s family and full of creative energy.
While Andy was pursuing his Master’s in Art, he ran into a problem: it was tough to find the quality art supplies he needed. Instead of waiting for a solution, he and Cynthia decided to create one. On August 1, 1968, they took a bold leap and opened Lenz Arts—first from their apartment, and a few months later, in a tiny 900-square-foot storefront (with a loft!) on Pacific Avenue, right at the edge of the old Pacific Garden Mall.
As the local art scene blossomed, so did the store. On July 6, 1972, Lenz Arts moved into its current home at 142 River Street, a spacious 10,000-square-foot building that once served as a community cold-storage facility—perfect for stocking even more supplies to fuel artists’ imaginations.
In 1976, Lenz Arts officially became incorporated, and the family business continued to grow—literally. In 1979, a young Andrew Jr., not yet a teen, cut his first picture framing mat under the guidance of his uncle Jerry, the head framer at the time.
Andrew Jr. later graduated from UCSC and took on the role of store manager in 1989. A true materials enthusiast, he’s spent decades geeking out with paint manufacturers, chemists, and even researchers from the Smithsonian to answer the most niche (and fascinating!) questions from customers and fellow artists.
In 1991, the Lenz family added a warehouse to support their ever-expanding frame inventory, which freed up even more floor space in the store—because, really, who doesn’t want room for more art supplies?
Today, Lenz Arts remains proudly family-run. Andy officially retired in 2016, and Cynthia gradually stepped back around the same time. Now, Andrew Jr. runs the day-to-day operations alongside his brother Matthew and a passionate crew of nearly two dozen artists and creatives.
That same year, Andy and Cynthia were honored in Houston, Texas with the International Art Materials Association's Lifetime Achievement Award—a fitting tribute to their dedication, creativity, and impact on the fine art materials world.

From our family to yours, thank you for making Lenz Arts a part of your creative life.

Lenz Arts in the News
Stories of resilience, recognition, and creative community.
For over five decades, Lenz Arts has been part of the Santa Cruz story. Below are some moments—both challenging and celebratory—that found their way into the headlines.

Rising from the Ashes (2002)
In March 2002, a two-alarm fire caused significant damage to our building. The fire started underneath the store and spread into the walls. Despite having no fire insurance, we were back up and running just 12 days later, thanks to long hours, a determined crew, and overwhelming community support.
